TODO for the next releases

Release 1.3.x
- Complete ODBC backend
- Check tests for more result sets (may be wrong if called twice after no more result sets are available)
- Can firebird use DSQL for transactions only or is a new TLB for each SET TRANSACTION necessary?

Release 1.5.x
- Prepared statement interface
- IBM DB2 backend
